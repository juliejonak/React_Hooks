# The useState Hook

One of the most important aspects of React is that components can own and manage their own state - in the past, this was by having a state property that was updated with the setState() method.

Now, with React Hooks, we no longer need classes for our stateful components because we can make functional components stateful using useState().

`useState()` takes in a single argument (the initial value for that piece of state). It returns an array with two parts: the state value and a way to update that state.

The simplest way to work with `useState` is to destructure the array and put it on one line like so:

```
const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState('light');
```

This invokes `useState` by setting the initial value to `light`, and allows us to reference the state in our comoponent as `theme` and allows us to update that state with `setTheme`.

We can update `theme` like so:

```
const toDark = () => setTheme('dark');
const toLight = () => setTheme('light');
```

Using these methods, we can update the state when invoked by calling `setTheme` and passing it an updated state.

Another way to think about `useState` is that it is preserving the value of state between renders, and triggers a re-render of the component as needed.

When `setTheme` is called, the state of `theme` is going to change, causing React to re-run the function to give a new UI based on that new state.

### How does this differ from class components?

Typically when running functions in JavaScript, the values of a function are garbage collected after the function has run.

For example, if we run this function:

```
function makeName () {
    const name = "Santa";
    const surname = "Claus";
};

makeName();
```

After `makeName` is called, we expect `name` and `surname` to be garbage collected because there is no longer a reference to either variable.

If we run `makeName` again, the variables `name` and `surname` will be re-made and then garbage collected again. Inherently, we know that those variables from the first instance of `makeName` are independent of the second instance. They aren't re-used or saved in the background. They're generated and stored only as long as the function is in use.

While React is made up of functional components, like the `makeName` function, it's easy to assume that their state is treated the same way. But that's not the case!

How do we know?

React renders the UI for components based on their state, so if the state were garbage collected after the function ran, our UI would disappear.

This implies that React has a way to preserve state even after a function is done running -- like `useState`.

When `toDark` is triggered by a user clicking the component, the `theme` state is set to `dark` and then the functional component re-runs. However, because React knows that `useState` was called for `theme` before, it renders the previously stored value (`dark`, which was set before the component re-ran).

This shows that React uses `useState` to preserve values of state between the function re-renders of a component, rather than creating independent instances of each state variable with each call.

(Unlike `useState` that re-renders the component when the state changes, `useRef` will update state but _not_ trigger a re-render of the component.)

<br>

### What is the difference between setState and useState?

With the introduction of `useState`, there is no longer an instance-wide way to update all of the state of the component, as there was with `setState`.

Instead, now each piece of state has its own specific updating function.

This also means there is no instance-wide way to set the _initial_ values of a component:

```
state = {
    loading: true,
    authed: false
}
```

Now, each piece of state should have its own invocation of `useState` and therefore its own value and updater functions:

```
const [ loading, setLoading ] = React.useState(true)
const [ authed, setAuthed ] = React.useState(false)
```

Previously, state was stored in an object and was updated by being passed a new object that it would merge with the old state.

Now, with `useState`, the old state object is completely replaced by the new state object.

<br>

What does this mean?

Previously, we could update part of the state object without eliminating other aspects:

```
state = {
    loading: true,
    authed: false
}

// This only modifies "loading", not "authed"
setLoading = (loading) => {
    this.setState({
        loading
    })
}
```

We could update `loading` and retain the existing stated of `authed`, even though it wasn't a key value pair in our new `setState` object. Merging objects retained unique key value pairs, while updating duplicates.

Now, using that same method with `useState` would override `authed` and remove it from state, like so:

```
const [ state, setState ] = React.useState({
    loading: true,
    authed: false
})

// This sets state.loading, but removes state.authed
const setLoading = (loading) => {
    setState({
        loading
    })
}
```

<br>

If the best data type for your state is an object, it would be better to use `useReducer` because of this change in how state is set with `useState`.

<br>
<br>

### Functional Updating

When using `setState`, best practice was to update state by passing it a function, not an object, because under the hood, the updating to state may happen asynchronously.

To ensure reliability, updating state should be done by passing a function that _receives_ state, rather than relying on referencing state from the component instance.

This remains true and best practice with Hooks as well.

<br>

To see this example, let's consider how we would increment a count based on a user clicking an `+` button. With `setState`, this would have looked like:

```
class Counter extends React.Component {
    state = { count: 0 }
    increment = () => this.setState( ({count}) => ({ count: count + 1}))

    render(){
        return (
            <React.Fragment>
                <button onClick={this.increment}> + </button>
                <h1>{this.state.count}</h1>
            </React.Fragment>
        )
    }
}
```

With `useState`, the logic looks very similar, despite transitioning from a Class component to a Functional component:

```
function Counter () {
    const [ count, setCount ] = React.useState(0)
    const increment = () => setCount( (count) => count + 1)

    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <button onClick={increment}> + </button>
            <h1>{count}</h1>
        <React.Fragment>
    )
}
```

<br>
<br>

### Lazy State Initialization

What if our state for a component is initialized based on an expensive function that runs a complex algorithm?

If we set the initial state by calling that function, it will be run each time the component re-renders, which isn't ideal if we only needed it once when the component first loads.

```
function Counter(){
    const [ count, setCount ] = React.useState(expensiveAlgorithm())
}
```

Calling `useState()` this ^ way will result in that expensive algorithm being re-run on each render.

<br>

`useState` has a special quality where if it receives a _function_ instead of an initial value, it will only run that function once when the component initially loads, not upon each re-render.

We would refactor our code to this instead:

```
function Counter(){
    const [ count, setCount ] = React.useState( () => expensiveAlgorithm() )
}
```

Now React is only invoking our expensive algorithm on the initial render, not on each subsequent render too.

<br>

And that's it! Now you have a good overview of how `useState` works and some of the differences between Hooks and the traditional way of setting state.
