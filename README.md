# React Hooks

This repo is dedicated to learning about React Hooks, both why they are important and how to execute them.

The information in this repo are heavily based on Tyler McGinnis' React Hooks course. To learn more, visit his tutorial website [here](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-hooks/).


Tyler's [15 minute overview video](https://youtu.be/eX_L39UvZes) does a fantastic job of explaining how we arrived at the current version of React, what issues existed without Hooks, and how Hooks solves those problems.
