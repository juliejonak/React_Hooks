# Execution Contexts, Scopes, and Closures

When writing software, often we'll choose to break it up into smaller pieces (components, modules, functions, etc), to help manage the complexity of reading and writing code.

If we apply this same thought process towards the JavaScript enginer that _interprets_ our code, we would call those smaller pieces `execution contexts`. They allow us to manage the complexity of interpreting code.

Using a [JavaScript Visualizer](https://tylermcginnis.com/javascript-visualizer/) tool, we can see how our code is being interpreted.

The first execution context that is created when JavaScript runs your code is called the `Global Execution Context`. This occurs if we "run" our code, even if there is no code written.

Initially it consists of a global object (the `window`) and a `this` object that points to the window object. We can think of it like so:

<br>

```
{
    window: {},
    this: window
}
```
